abstract = {We have worked on the development of a character recognition system in the soft computing paradigm. In this paper we present a genetic algorithm used for feature selection with a Feature Quality Index (FQI) metric. We generate feature vectors by defining fuzzy sets on Hough transform of character pattern pixels. Each feature element is multiplied by a mask vector bit before reaching the input of a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The genetic algorithm operates on the bit string represented by the mask vector to select the best set of features. The method has been tested with three benchmark data sets and the results show a fast convergence of the genetic algorithm. A Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection in a Neuro-Fuzzy.},

abstract = {We present a rhythm-based method for the automatic generation of levels for 2D platformers, where the rhythm is that which the player feels with his hands while playing. Levels are created using a grammar-based method: first generating rhythms, then generating geometry based on those rhythms. Generation is constrained by a set of style parameters tweakable by a human designer. The approach also minimizes the amount of content that must be manually authored, instead relying on geometry components that are included in the level designer's tileset and a set of jump types. Our results show that this method produces an impressive variety of levels, all of which are fully playable.},

@techreport{Standish2003,
abstract = {Of all the issues discussed at Alife VII: Looking Forward, Looking Backward, the issue of whether it was possible to create an artificial life system that exhibits open-ended evolution of novelty is by far the biggest. Of the 14 open problems settled on as a result of debate at the conference, some 6 are directly, or indirectly related to this issue. Most people equate open-ended evolution with complexity growth, although a priori these seem to be different things. In this paper I report on experiments to measure the complexity of Tierran organisms, and show the results for a size-neutral run of Tierra. In this run, no increase in organismal complexity was observed, although organism size did increase through the run. This result is discussed, offering some signposts on path to solving the issue of open ended evolution.},

@techreport{Renz,
abstract = {The Angry Birds AI Competition 1 has been held annually since 2012 in conjunction with some of the major AI conferences , most recently with IJCAI 2015. The goal of the competition is to build AI agents that can play new Angry Birds levels as good as or better than the best human players. Successful agents should be able to quickly analyze new levels and to predict physical consequences of possible actions in order to select actions that solve a given level with a high score. Agents have no access to the game internal physics, but only receive screenshots of the live game. In this paper we describe why this problem is a challenge for AI, and why it is an important step towards building AI that can successfully interact with the real world. We also sum-marise some highlights of past competitions, including a new competition track we introduced recently.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe our design of a generator for automatically generating fun levels in the famous game Angry Birds and its clone games. In particular, we aim at generation of character-sequence levels. In order to generate fun levels, we propose a pattern-struct approach and a preset-model approach. The pattern-struct approach generates each time different appearance for one of the alphabetical letters, numeral numbers, or some symbols. The preset-model approach is used for increasing the legibility and diversity, where models are built in advance for some capital letters and numbers. Our level generator, called Funny Quotes, was the winner of the Fun Track of the CIG 2016 Level Generation Competition held in 2016 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games. After raising issues residing in Funny Quotes through user-evaluation results in terms of legibility of characters in generated levels and of playability of those levels, we propose and evaluate new mechanisms for ensuring the disparity in difficulty among easy, normal, and hard levels for the 2017 competition.},
